 Q24 Difference between inheritance and polymorphism

 Ans :
 ➡️Inheritance :

    -> whenever once class access another class properties it's called Inheritance.

    ->Types Of Inheritance:
        1.Multiple Inheritance
        2.Multilevel Inheritance
        3.Hybrid Inheritance
        4.Hierarchical Inheritance
        5.Single Inheritance


        -> Note : Multiple Inheritance can not support in Inheritance , but it can archive with interface method.

        ->Inheritance is main purpose is code re-usability


 ➡️Polymorphism :
       -> the word polymorphism has been derived from greek words "poly" and "morph"
          where poly means many and morph means from

       -> polymorphism means an object have different form performs same action/task
         in multiple/Different Ways

       ->Type of Polymorphism :
            1.Method Overloading
            2.Method Overriding

            1.Method Overloading :
                The method who has same name as class name but different Parameter
                it's called method overloading.

            2.Method Overriding :
                The method who has same name method and same parameter but different class
                it's called method overriding.

               note : method overriding cant not support in dart language.
