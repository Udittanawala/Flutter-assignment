Q22 - Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why? B3. What is
      advantage of inheritance?

Ans:
->  In Dart, Multiple Inheritance is not supported in Inheritance .
    because in Multiple inheritance can not support same name method and same name variable in parent class .
    in that condition compiler is confusing compile the code .
-> explain with example :
    when the 2 parents class exiting and 1 child class exiting .
    and both parent class has same method like display() . whenever we called this method with child class object trough .
    that time compiler is confusing what method can run project.

-> but, We can achieve multiple inheritance using interface Method.

Advantages of inheritance :-

    Code Reusability :- Inheritance allows a new class to reuse the properties and methods of an
                        existing class, reducing code duplication.
